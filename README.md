# Vision and Cognitive Systems Project

Welcome to the repository for the final project of the Vision and Cognitive Systems course, conducted in Padova during the academic year 2023/2024 by Professor L. Ballan.
Thank you for exploring this repository!

## Project Overview
#### Neural style transfer: turn your photos into artwork
Within this repository, you'll find comprehensive documentation and source code that encapsulates our exploration and application of concepts taught during the course. Our project revolves around Neural style transfer (NST) algorithm in computer vision.

## Project Documentation
This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the original Neural style transfer paper ([Gatys et al.](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/paper/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)).
